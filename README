The libopenstm32l1 project derives from the libopenstm32 which is the ancestor
of the libopencm3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The libopencm3 project aims to create an open-source firmware library for
various ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

The library is written completely from scratch based on the vendor datasheets,
programming manuals, and application notes. The code is meant to be used
with a GCC toolchain for ARM (gcc-arm-embedded https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-
embedded), programming the Flash memory in a microcontroller can be done
using the OpenOCD ARM JTAG software.

Status and API
--------------

The libopencm3 project is currently work in progress. Not all subsystems
of the microcontrollers are supported, yet.

Building
--------

 $ make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Example projects
----------------

The library ships with a few small example projects which illustrate how
individual subsystems of the microcontrollers can be configured and used
with libopencm3.

For programming the 'miniblink' example (after you built libopencm3 and the
examples by typing 'make' at the top-level directory) you can execute:

 # cd examples/stm32/l1/stm32-h152/miniblink
 # make flash

The Makefiles of the examples are configured to use a certain OpenOCD
JTAG adapter, you might need to change some of the variables in the
openocd.cfg if you use a different one.

You can also program manually like this:

 # export OOCD_INTERFACE=jtagkey-tiny
 # openocd -f ../openocd.cfg &
 # telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase foobar.hex
 > shutdown

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny" with whatever JTAG adapter you are using.
Replace "foobar.hex" with the file name of the image you want to program.

After programming you must once power off (disconnect USB connector)
and then power on again (reconnect USB connector), do power-on reset.


Installation
------------

 $ make install

This will install the library in your toolchain directrory. If you want to
install it elsewhere, use the following syntax:

 $ make DESTDIR=/home/mydir/mylib install

Suspend:

It is possible to suspend USB device using sysfs.

 # dmesg
 ....
 [ ...] usb 1-1.6.4: new full-speed USB device number 15 using ehci-pci
 [ ...] usb 1-1.6.4: New USB device found, idVendor=2975, idProduct=0001
 [ ...] usb 1-1.6.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
 [ ...] usb 1-1.6.4: Product: Custom Device
 [ ...] usb 1-1.6.4: Manufacturer: MPC Research Ltd.
 .... 
 # cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.6.4/power/control
 on
 # cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.6.4/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
 2000
 # echo auto > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.6.4/power/control
 # 


Resume:

The device is resumed by host access.
The device should be resumed by pushing the button (WAKEUP) too.
But it seems that rececnt linux kernel doesn't permit the device to send
the resume request.
I confirmed that the device was able to send the resume request on
FreeBSD 9.1.
